        <p>
            Data visualization is a way of representing data in a form of graphical representation 
            to help the viewer to understand the data that is being visualized. Other countries such 
            as United States of America, United Kingdom, Australia and India have visualization their 
            election result data using map visualization. However, most of election data in Malaysia 
            are represented in tabular format and non-interactive graphs. This creates a problem for 
            certain viewers because they could not understand the context of the data. The aim of this 
            project is to represent the election result data in a simplified approach using hexagon 
            tile grid map data visualization. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript and D3.js 
            library to create hexagon tile grid map data visualization that visualizing the election 
            data in Malaysia map. The system consists of three level of information. The first level 
            shows the hexagon tile grid map of Malaysia. The second level contains the gender distribution 
            of the state. The third level shows the election result with winning party and candidate, 
            besides of ethnic distribution of the selected parliament. This project is validated by 
            comparing the output with the given input data. This project has successfully visualized 
            the election result accurately. This visualization helps to simplify the representation 
            of the election data and the viewer can understand the data easier.
